                    <p class="article-content">In Japanese anime, it is common to have a definite set of character archetypes you will see again and again. In most cases, they are somewhat exaggerated, either for narrative purposes or to please the viewers. There are a few anime cartoons that contain only realistic portrayals of characters and thank God, Nana is one of them. It does not rely on any tricks to try and get a reaction out of audience.</p>

                        might resume the manga being that her health was looking better. But this was in 2022. Has there
                        been any updates from her since?

                    <p class="news-p">At the end of the day, the Nana anime does not have much hope for a return. It is a canceled anime released over a decade ago for a manga that in itself is incomplete. So long as the manga is incomplete, a second season seems unlikely, and the manga’s return is rather unlikely for the foreseeable future as well.</p>

The future was looking bright for everyone involved. Unfortunately, this story was not to last, and in 2009 the series went on a hiatus that it has not returned from since.
